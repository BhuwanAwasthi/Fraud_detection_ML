# Fraud Detection System

## Introduction

This project aims to tackle financial fraud by analyzing transaction data to identify fraudulent activities. Utilizing Python and several powerful libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost, we've developed a comprehensive pipeline to preprocess data, detect outliers, visualize correlations, and apply machine learning models for predictive analysis.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleansing and preparation of transaction data for analysis.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identification and handling of outliers in transaction amounts using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Visualization of feature correlations with a heatmap.
- **Feature Engineering**: Encoding categorical variables and creating new features to highlight discrepancies in account balances.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Application of RandomForest and XGBoost classifiers to predict fraudulent transactions.
- **Evaluation**: Detailed performance evaluation of models using classification reports and precision-recall curves.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

```
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost
```

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system to use these libraries effectively.

## Usage

1. Place your dataset at `/content/drive/MyDrive/Fraud.csv` or modify the path in the script to match your dataset location.
2. Run the script in a Python environment. The script will:
   - Perform data preprocessing and visualization.
   - Fit RandomForest and XGBoost models on the training data.
   - Evaluate the models on the test set and display the results.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the fraud detection accuracy or extend the project's functionality are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.
